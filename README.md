# GOAMLP: Network Intrusion Detection with Multilayer Perceptron and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm

## Introduction
GOAMLP combines the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks to enhance the performance of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). GOA is a swarm-based optimization technique inspired by the natural behavior of grasshoppers. This algorithm is known for its strong exploration and exploitation capabilities, making it effective for training neural networks like MLP.

This repository contains the implementation of the GOAMLP algorithm along with datasets and evaluation metrics as described in the published paper.

## Algorithm Overview
The GOAMLP algorithm uses the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) to optimize the weights and biases of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). This hybrid approach aims to improve the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of IDS by finding optimal solutions through the GOA's exploration and exploitation mechanisms.

### üìù Key Features:
- High accuracy and sensitivity for intrusion detection.
- Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) for improved training of MLP.
- Applicable to various IDS datasets, including KDD and UNSW-NB15.
- Efficient computational performance with reduced error rates.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of GOAMLP is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy:** Measures the correct detection rate.
- **Sensitivity:** Reflects the model‚Äôs ability to identify positive instances.
- **Specificity:** Assesses the model‚Äôs ability to detect negative instances.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Quantifies the prediction error.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures the standard deviation of prediction errors.
