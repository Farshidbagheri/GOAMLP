# GOAMLP: A Novel Optimization Algorithm for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

## Introduction
GOAMLP (Genetic Optimized Adaptive Multi-Layer Perceptron) is a novel machine learning algorithm specifically designed to optimize Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by leveraging genetic algorithms. This repository contains the implementation of the GOAMLP algorithm along with datasets and evaluation metrics. 

The GOAMLP algorithm aims to enhance the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of IDS by integrating genetic optimization with multi-layer perceptron networks. The project is based on the paper published by Farshid Bagheri and collaborators, where the results demonstrate significant improvements compared to existing methods.

## Algorithm Overview
The GOAMLP algorithm integrates Genetic Optimization techniques with MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to enhance IDS performance. The primary objective is to minimize error rates while maximizing detection accuracy.

### Key Features:
- High accuracy and sensitivity for intrusion detection.
- Genetic optimization to improve model adaptability.
- Applicable to various IDS datasets, including KDD and UNSW-NB15.
- Efficient computational performance with reduced error rates.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of GOAMLP is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy:** Measures the correct detection rate.
- **Sensitivity:** Reflects the modelâ€™s ability to identify positive instances.
- **Specificity:** Assesses the modelâ€™s ability to detect negative instances.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Quantifies the prediction error.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures the standard deviation of prediction errors.
